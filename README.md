Project Overview

This project delivers an IPv4/IPv6 Address Application that retrieves a user's public IP address information and displays it in a user-friendly format. It leverages an external API to obtain geolocation data associated with the IP address.

Application Features:

Displays the user's public IP address (IPv4 and IPv6, if available).
Provides user geolocation information, including:
Country code
Country name (if available from the API)
City (if available from the API)
Region (if available from the API)
Optionally allows users to enter a specific IP address to retrieve information for a different location. (This functionality can be implemented depending on the chosen API.)
Project Objectives:

Develop an application to fetch and display the user's current public IP address.
Utilize an external API to retrieve geolocation data associated with the IP address.
Provide a user-friendly interface for displaying the retrieved information. (This can be a command-line interface or a graphical user interface depending on the chosen implementation.)
Deliverables:

Python source code for the application.
(Optional) Documentation for installation and usage instructions.
(Optional, depending on implementation) Compiled executable or GUI application package.
Technologies Used:

Python (programming language)
External IP geolocation API (specific API to be determined based on chosen provider)
